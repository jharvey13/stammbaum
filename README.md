# stammbaum
Stammbaum tells the history of a family via photos, stories, research, and history.
Itâ€™s focus is less on raw data and more on preservation of memory for the present
and future generations. While basic genealogy data will be kept, Stammbaum will
maintain personal histories, relationships, and media.
